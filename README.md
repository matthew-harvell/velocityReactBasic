*This evaluation consists of two sections. One is mandatory while the
other is at your discretion given the time frame available.*


The mandatory section involves hydrating a function. This function is
located inside the Utils/NumberFunctions.js file. Please follow the
instructions there. For the purpose of speeding your task up:


Prime numbers from 1 to 24: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23 and therefore the
non-prime numbers are: 1,4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21,22,24 in that
same range. You will need to add enough React code to this application
(component or just inline) to be able to call this function and
validate that it is functioning correctly.

After the mandatory section is completed, please feel free to
implement _any_ of the following tasks which you believe you
can complete in the time still available:


-  Create a React component that will accept a comma-delimited string
of numbers, parse this string and calculate the primality for each
number in the string and display the results in a table, e.g.:

| Number | Is it prime? |
|--------|--------------|
| 3      | Yes          |
| 4      | No           |

_You may style it any way you wish._
- The cost of recalculating primality can, be quite costly. Use the
memoization pattern to reduce this time. Consider using a{" "}
`Map` object or, perhaps, another collection to help out.
